Approach for S3 Bucket Optimization Challenge üöÄ
1Ô∏è‚É£ Reading the Bucket Data:
Load buckets.json using Python's json module.
Extract bucket details such as name, region, size, versioning status, and policies.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Processing and Modifications:
Identify which buckets need optimization (e.g., disabling versioning, resizing, updating policies).
Modify the necessary attributes like versioning, sizeGB, and tags.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Updating the JSON File:
Write the modified bucket details back to buckets.json to ensure changes persist.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Logging and Output:
Print a summary of the existing bucket details.
Display modifications applied to specific buckets.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling:
Handle cases where buckets.json is missing or incorrectly formatted.
Implement try-except blocks to prevent script crashes.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Version Control with Git:
Upload s3_optimization.py and buckets.json to GitHub for tracking.
Document the approach, challenges, and learnings in README.md.

üö® Challenges I Faced & Their Solutions
1Ô∏è‚É£ TypeError: "string indices must be integers, not 'str'"
‚úÖ Problem:
My script initially tried to access dictionary keys incorrectly, treating a JSON string as if it were already parsed data.
‚úÖ Solution:
I  correctly loaded the JSON data using json.load() and accessed bucket details properly.

2Ô∏è‚É£ NameError: "name 'data' is not defined"
‚úÖ Problem:
My script referenced data["buckets"], but data wasn‚Äôt assigned properly.
‚úÖ Solution:
I ensured data was correctly loaded from the JSON file before accessing buckets.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensuring Correct Bucket Modifications
‚úÖ Problem:
I needed to modify a specific bucket (prod-data) while keeping the structure of buckets.json intact.
‚úÖ Solution:
I successfully updated the versioning and sizeGB properties for the prod-data bucket, then saved the changes.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Validating Changes Were Saved
‚úÖ Problem:
After modifying the bucket, I needed to ensure the changes persisted in buckets.json.
‚úÖ Solution:
My script printed the updated bucket details and confirmed that changes were saved.
